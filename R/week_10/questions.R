# how important to use for the graph/ ggplot the type of result : data.frame, list, data.table

# how to convert the list file to the data.file, when the rows doesn't have the same numbers of row 

# is it important to use list in our project as result

# which is the best to have as result in R : data.frame. data.table or list file 

# how to convert file to each others
  # list to data.frame
  # data.frame to list
  # data.frame to data.table
  # data.table to data.frame
  # ? list to data.table and data.table to list

# depanse of the file(
  
# 1- we should always have the data.frame file or list with key and value in for loop 
#2- collection the links for different item 
# 3- using "lapplay" method as loop for looking over of the links of the list and function 
#4-  'rbind' list for conected the data.frame with same name of column and have one result in the end 
# (rbindList(fill = True)) is the way we can combine dtat.frame with different columns
